# AI_Assignments
Coding assignments created for the course CSE241N: Artificial Intelligence (Jan'18-May-18) 
Course Repository: https://github.com/CSE241N-Fall18/CSE241N-ArtificialIntelligenceFall18

This repository contains the two assignments which I had made independently (almost -- other members of the TA team were responsible for testing these assignments):
* Assignment 2: Linear Regression
* Assignment 8: Fully Connected Neural Networks

I also contributed (as a tester) to two other assignments on Viterbi Algorithm and Logistic Regression. [They are not uploaded here].
